change log:
(these change notes are here for checking old versions since i'm now using releases for changelogs)

ver 2.6:
1) good news! ... the infamous navigator function bug has been fixed completely and you no longer need to add a no-navigator to the a tag that should not trigger the function (the function now is triggered on page leave which is also good news since the function no longer needs to query all a tags in the page)
2) added a very promising elementObserver function that can be called in any js file to detect if the element is in the screen, the function takes two parameters, the callback function to be executed if the element is intersepting and an options document that is passed by default to the callback function
3) added an aspect ratio script to determine the height based on the width (same as the box-ratio mixin but this one does not use padding but actually determine the height on the fly based on width) to use it put the ratio (width/height) in an html attribute data-aspectRatio
4) added an animation script file, based on animate.css, and added the appropriate imports. this script checks for data-animate and data-delay and adds animation to elements as they enter the screen, curtesy of the all powerful elementObserver function.
5) you can now customize the img width and height of the loader from the loader mixin
6) added a sidebar__inner class that takes care of sticky sidebars by defaut (put is as the direct child of the side bar)
7) added a mixin called arrow that creates arrows without the use of characters or fonts (next update is going to emplement those in the slick slider theme)
8) added the inset option to the curve mixin for inset curves
9) added a very primitive insetborder mixin ... will be expanded in later releases
10) optimized the checking of functions in the helpers file to save some performance
11) fixed some issues with the contact form 7 mixin
12) fixed some issues with the slick slider mixin (lets hope this is really the last time we will edit this mixin again)
13) fixed the appDirRtl and appDirLtr being the opposite of what the name indicates
14) updated dependencies to solve some vulnerabilities, and did some code cleanup and some performance optimizations (this has been a very big release)


ver 2.5:
1) removed the arrow font from slick slider ... it was causing some performance problems
1.1) slick slider css is now a mixin that you need to call as you see fit 
2) removed wp bootstrap dublicate file
3) the theme name and version and description have been updated, and the usage guid has been improved (still could be better)
4) added a scss file with some edits to the woocommerce styles which should be a good starting point
5) fixed some issues introduced in 2.4 (sorry.)

ver 2.4:
1) added woo-commerce templates (almost complete and without a parent theme)
2) readded the functions folder and imported it in the functions.php file
3) the woocommerce-related helpers are in a separate file called woo-helpers and by default it's import is commented in the functions.php file
4) added support for contact-form 7
4.1) add the 'form-group' and 'form-control' classes in the form builder your self
4.2) add classes 'row-first' and 'row-last' to fields (same level as 'form-group') for two inputs in the same line
5) added ability to remove a child element(s) with a certain tag by adding 'data-removeChildTag' to the parent div that you want to remove the tag(s) from (for example remove all a tags etc.)
6) added cookie control functions (setCookie, getCookie, eraseCookie)
7) for links that shouldn't trigger the navigation add the 'no-navigator' class to them

ver 2.3:
1) added a function to check string length and trim it as required (add data-trim="number" to trim the string to the same length as that number)
2) added a replace function to replace strings (add data-replace="character-to-change" and data-replace-with)
3) added a function to use different images for mobile and desktop depending on screen width (the functions name is det_responsive_images and more instructions can be found in the dunctions.php file)
4) added a bottom sheet component (similar to google material)
5) added the bootstrap walker function so now you can use the wp_nav_menu function for navbars 
6) modified the walker so that now it accepts 2 dropdowns on hover and clicking takes you to the link required
7) added a box shadow class that acts as a vail to content inside (still .vail has its uses)
8) fixed a bug where the body tag didnt cover all elements in the screen

ver 2.2:
1) added a professional lazy loading script (use the same way as before but the class is not lazy its lazyload)
2) added a script to remove the old jquery from wordpress and replace it with a newer one
3) added a responsive image function to determine and echo the srcset of images
4) added other helper functions to functions.php
5) reduced the js load of the navigator scripts (at this point if you don't use a site loader don't bother importing the file)
6) added some helper scripts (add active class to the nav link that matches the current page and added a show dropdown on hover script for bootstrap dropdowns)
7) added a pagination mixin (among other new mixins) and a new function that handles pagination in wordpress (in functions.php)
8) removed the webp converter since it had no real life applications
9) fully integrated slick slider (all of its imports are commented you just need to remove the comment from scss entry and js bundle)

ver 2.1:
1) added wp files to the theme to facilitate migrating to wordpress if you like
2) the work flow is still the same ... you develop the theme in the src folder and run build when you are done but now the result is a valid wp theme
3) updated my instructions on working with the theme to include the wp way of things
4) added a gulp task to fix the broken image sources in php files when you first copy them
4.1) the task's command is: gulp phpMigrate --file=path to file.php
4.2) yes this task is file specific (to make it stupid people proof, but you're more than welcome to edit it if you like)
5) added a slick theme file to the helpers (import it instead of the one that comes with slick slider ... it has some bug fixes)

1) fixed some css bugs
2) added slick carousel to the theme

ver 2.0.4:
1) fixed the jquery import problem (in navigator)

3) removed sourcemaps from js files (it took around 3s for it to compile .. who has the time right?)

ver 2.0:

2) reduced imports to one style and one script (both called either bundle or bundle-rtl)

4) added a list component that accepts an icon with various customizable variables

6) navigating between pages now is alot smoother thanks to the previous two points and the loader

ver 1.1.5:
